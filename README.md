# FH6 All-in-One Trainer

An all-in-one trainer for **Forza Horizon 6** — runtime hooks for player profile values + car/physics cheats + live SQL access to the game's in-memory database. Self-contained `.exe`, no .NET install needed.

> **Offline mode only.** This trainer modifies game memory. Online play (Rivals, Eventlab, Multiplayer, leaderboards) will not work and may result in a ban. Run FH6 in offline mode before using.

## Download

Latest release: **[GitHub Releases](../../releases)** — download the `.zip`, extract, and run `FH6AllInOneTrainer.exe` as Administrator.
