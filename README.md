# FH6 All-in-One Trainer

An all-in-one trainer for **Forza Horizon 6** — runtime hooks for player profile values + car/physics cheats + live SQL access to the game's in-memory database. Single-file `.exe`, no extra runtime needed.

> ⚠️ **Use at your own risk.** This trainer modifies game memory. Microsoft / Turn 10 can ban your account. **Solo / Free Roam only — never use online (Rivals, Eventlab, Multiplayer, leaderboards).**

## ✅ Working Features

### Quick Actions (Unlocks Page)
- **Quick Start** — 999M Credits + Free Cars + Autoshow Unlock + All Cars in Garage, one click
- **Max All** — set Credits 999M, Wheelspins 999, Super Wheelspins 999, Skill Points 999K in one click

### Profile Values (Unlocks Page)
- **Credits (CR)** — custom value with presets (10K, 100K, 1M, 100M, 999M), locked
- **Wheelspins** — custom count with presets (10, 50, 100, 999)
- **Super Wheelspins** — custom count with presets (10, 50, 100, 999)
- **Skill Points** — custom value with presets (100, 1K, 10K, 999K), locked
- **Sell Payout x** — multiply car sell price by any factor

### Car & Physics (Unlocks Page)
- **Freeze AI** — stops all AI Drivatar cars during races (zeroes their velocity)
- **Teleport to Waypoint** — instantly teleport to any map waypoint
- **No Clip** — disable collision detection, drive through walls and terrain
- **Gravity Multiplier** — adjust gravity (low gravity, moon gravity, etc.)
- **No Water Drag** — remove water resistance when driving through lakes/rivers
- **Remove Build Cap** — remove engine swap / build power limit

### World & Events (Unlocks Page)
- **Time of Day** — set any hour (6 = dawn, 12 = noon, 18 = dusk, 0 = midnight)
- **Skill Score Multiplier** — multiply skill chain score earned (5x, 10x, 100x)
- **Prize Scale** — multiply wheelspin reward value (5x, 10x, 50x)
- **Race Time Scale** — slow down or speed up race timer (0 = freeze timer)

### SQL Database (Database Page)
- **Unlock Everything** — applies all 5 SQL cheats at once (one click)
- **Free Cars (LOCK)** — BaseCost stays at 0 forever (re-applied every 10s)
- **Autoshow All Visible (LOCK)** — every car stays in showroom
- **Install Flags (LOCK)** — IsInstalled / IsPurchased / IsDrivable stay at 1
- **Clear NEW Tag** — remove persistent NEW! badges from garage
- **Add All Cars** — grant every car free (reopen game to claim)

Each LOCK toggle re-applies its SQL every 10 seconds. Backup tables are created automatically — toggling OFF restores originals.

## 🛡️ Safety Features (v3.0.0)

- **Toggle locks** — all cheat toggles are disabled when FH6 is not running; red warning banner shown
- **System tray** — closing the window minimizes to tray instead of quitting; right-click for Show/Exit
- **Conflict detection** — warns if another trainer (ForzaMods AIO, WeMod, etc.) is already running
- **Signature scan mode** — test all AOB patterns against current FH6 binary without installing hooks
- **Profile system** — save and load cheat configurations to named JSON profiles

## 🛡️ Stability & Anti-Detection

- **CRC bypass** auto-armed before any hook (vtable function pointer swap + 10s re-arm timer)
- **Hook self-healing** — every 10s the engine re-applies patches the game tries to roll back
- **ExpectedOriginal sanity check** — refuses to inject if target bytes don't match (no crashes from outdated signatures)
- **Auto-detach** when the game exits or crashes — no writes to dead processes
- **Two-phase CRC dance** — restores originals for 1 second so the game's integrity check passes, then re-applies patches

## ⚠️ Broken (game patched)

- Drift Score Multiplier
- No Skill Break

## 🔧 Build from Source
