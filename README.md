# FH6 All-in-One Trainer

An all-in-one trainer for **Forza Horizon 6** — runtime hooks for player profile values + car/physics cheats + live SQL access to the game's in-memory database. Self-contained `.exe`, no .NET install needed.

> **Offline mode only.** This trainer modifies game memory. Online play (Rivals, Eventlab, Multiplayer, leaderboards) will not work and may result in a ban. Run FH6 in offline mode before using.

## Download

Latest release: **[GitHub Releases](../../releases)** — download the `.zip`, extract, and run `FH6AllInOneTrainer.exe` as Administrator.

## Features

### Profile Values (runtime hooks)
- **Credits** — set any amount (10K to 999M). Toggle on, then reopen the Credits tab to see the updated value.
- **Wheelspins** — set count (10–999). Toggle on, then spin once for it to lock.
- **Super Wheelspins** — set count (10–999). Same as Wheelspins — spin once to activate.
- **Skill Points** — set any amount. Toggle on, then spend a point for the change to take effect.
- **Sell Payout** — multiply car sell prices by any value.
- **Drift Score** — multiply drift score by any value (5x, 10x, 50x, or custom).
- **No Skill Break** — prevents skill chains from breaking on impacts.

Uses inline code cave hooks with toggle+value slots — based on the paris' club approach (CALL-resolution with string-compare verification).

### Quick Actions
- **Quick Start** — 999M Credits + Free Cars + Autoshow Unlock + Install Flags + All Cars
- **Max All** — max Credits, Wheelspins, Super Wheelspins, Skill Points

### SQL Database (in-memory SQLite)
- **Unlock Everything** — all SQL cheats in one click
- Free Cars (BaseCost=0), Autoshow Unlock, Install Flags — with persistent locks that re-apply every 10s
- Add All Cars (CarBuckets approach), Free Upgrades (47 tables), Free Wheels, Full Autoshow
- Unlock Upgrade Presets, Clear "NEW!" Tag

### Physics & Performance (SQL)
- Drift Score 10x, Max Traction, Torque 2x, Reduce Drag 0.5x

## Anti-Cheat Bypass

- CRC bypass with heartbeat timer + jitter (XXH check pointer replacement)
- 3/5 integrity check patches (MemCmp, CodeSection, Checksum)
- Thread-safe patching with ExpectedOriginal sanity check
- Pre-resolution: all hook targets are scanned before any hooks are installed

## Known Limitations

- **PageHash and TextHash integrity patches not found** on the latest FH6 builds (2/5 integrity patches missing). This may cause delayed game crashes on some systems. A full disassembly is in progress to find the correct signatures.
- **Value Encryption bypass signature not found** on latest builds. Some profile value changes may not persist between sessions.
- **XP / Level modding** is not yet supported. See [issue #19](../../issues/19) for discussion.
- Teleport, Freeze AI, timers, gravity, and other experimental cheats from earlier versions were removed — they used signatures that matched the wrong functions and didn't work reliably.

## Build from Source

Requires **.NET 10 SDK** on Windows:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained
```
